               <floruit notBefore="1916" notAfter="1930">Zawditu was the empress of <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/> from <date>1916</date>to
                  <date>1930</date>. As a child Zawditu stayed at her father's court under the care of <persName ref="PRS2342Bafana"/>, and then his next wife, 
                  <persName ref="PRS9345taytuBe"/>.  In <date>1882</date>, the 6-year-old Zawditu  was married to the 13-year-old 
                  <persName ref="PRS2012Arayas"/>. But <persName ref="PRS2012Arayas"/> died in <date>1888</date>.
                  In <date>1889</date> Zawditu returned to her father's court. In <date>1891</date>, she was married to <persName ref="PRS4902Gwangul"/>, 
                  but the marriage did not last.
                  In <date>1897</date> Zawditu married to <roleName type="title">daǧǧāzmāč</roleName>
                  <persName ref="PRS10100WebeAt"/>. Finally, in <date>1900</date>, Zawditu  married to 
                  <persName ref="PRS4872GugsaWa"/>, and moved with him to <placeName ref="LOC2384DabraT"/>. 
                  When <persName ref="PRS7006Menilek"/>'s health declined by <date>1907/1908</date>, Zawditu returned to 
                  <placeName ref="LOC1216AddisA"/>, together with <persName ref="PRS9345taytuBe"/>, nursed her father. 
                  Following the death of <persName ref="PRS7006Menilek"/>, <persName ref="PRS5620IyasuV"/>
                  put Zawditu under house arrest in 
                  <placeName ref="LOC3035Fale"/>, where her husband had been confined ever since <persName ref="PRS9345taytuBe"/> 
                  was forced from power in <date>1910</date>. Following the overthrown of <persName ref="PRS5620IyasuV"/>, 
                  in <date>1916</date>, Zawditu was asked to ascend the throne. The condition was, however,
                  that she separated from her husband, and thus Zawditu and <persName ref="PRS4872GugsaWa"/> divorced in <date>1916</date>. 
                  Then, Zawditu ascended to the imperial throne on <date>1916-10-02</date> and was crowned <roleName type="title">nǝgǝśta nagaśtāt</roleName>
                  in the <placeName ref="LOC3292Gannat"/> on <date>1917-02-11</date>. But she had no experience in politics and adminsitration.
                  She was believed to be deeply religious, shy but also stubborn. Thus, throughtime, the balance of power gradually shifted in favour of  the then Tafari and later <persName ref="PRS5226haylase"/>, who consequently removed his opponents  and Zawditu 's associates from power. 
                  For the last two years of her life, she was deprived from any political power, even if she still presided formally over the Crown Council.
