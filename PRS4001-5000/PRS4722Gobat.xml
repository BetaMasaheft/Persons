               <floruit notBefore="1825" notAfter="1879">He was a famous Protestant missionary in
                     <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/> in the 19th century. He started his career
                     in <date>1825</date>, when he was sent to <placeName ref="LOC4325London"/>, at
                  the age of 22 for a mission to <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/>. As part of his
                  preparation to <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/>, Gobat studied Gǝʿǝz and also
                  learnt Amharic from an Ethiopian monk. He arrived in <date>1830</date> in <placeName ref="LOC1212Addigr"/> together with his colleague <persName ref="PRS6096Kugler"/>
                  where they were cordially received by the ruler of <placeName ref="LOC6569Tegray"/>, <persName ref="PRS8265Sabagadi"/>. Then in March <date>1830</date>, he
                  travelled to <placeName ref="LOC3577Gondar"/> in order to see the country and
                  distribute the Amharic Bibles the missionaries had brought with them. He committed
                  himself to persuading the priests and laypeople of the need to reform the
                  Orthodox Church. The reform he advocated comprised the institutionalizing of
                  theological education, the renewal of the establishment of several Ethiopian held
                  bishoprics, the removal of images from the Ethiopian churches and the abolition of
                  the veneration of saints. He left <placeName ref="LOC3577Gondar"/> in
                     <date>1830</date> and returned to <placeName ref="LOC1264Adwa"/>, <placeName ref="LOC6569Tegray"/> where the circumstances were less favourable for his
                  mission. When his health deteriorated during <date>1832</date>, he returned to
                     <placeName ref="LOC4325London"/>. There he managed for his plan to renew
                  missionary activity in <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/>. In <date>1846</date>, he
                  was chosen as bishop for the newly established Anglican Lutheran bishopric of
                     <placeName ref="LOC3957Jerusa"/> which included <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"/>
                  as well. Thus, he was asked by <persName ref="PRS1688AliAlul"/> in
                     <date>1850</date> to supervise the Ethiopian convent in <placeName ref="LOC3957Jerusa"/>. </floruit>
